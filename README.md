## üìã Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed on your machine:

- Java: JDK 17+.
- Build Tool: Maven (used in this project).
- Docker version 20+
- Docker Compose version 2.5+

## üìù Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:chertiav/booking-app.git
  cd booking-app
```

### Step 2: Configure the .env File
In the root directory of the project, create a new file named `.env`.
This file will store the environment variables necessary to configure the database and application.

Add the following variables to the `.env` file based on the provided template:

```
# PostgreSQL Configuration
POSTGRES_USER=your_postgres_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
POSTGRES_DB=booking_db
POSTGRES_LOCAL_PORT=5432
POSTGRES_DOCKER_PORT=5432

# Spring Boot Configuration
SPRING_LOCAL_PORT=8080
SPRING_DOCKER_PORT=8080
DEBUG_PORT=5005

# JWT Configuration
JWT_EXPIRATION=86400000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME=your_telegram_bot_username

# Scheduler Configuration
SCHEDULER_CRON_HOURLY=0 0 * * * *
SCHEDULER_CRON_DAILY_NINE=0 0 9 * * *
SCHEDULER_CRON_MINUTE=0 * * * * *
SCHEDULER_CRON_TIME_ZONE=Europe/Kiev

# Stripe Configuration
STRIP_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIP_CURRENCY=USD

# Application Base URL
APP.BASE.URL=http://localhost:8080/api
```

Replace the placeholders with actual values. For example:
```
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=securepassword
JWT_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP12345678
```

**Descriptions of Required Variables**:
- `POSTGRES_USER` ‚Äî The username for the PostgreSQL database.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` ‚Äî Password for the PostgreSQL database user.
- `POSTGRES_DB` ‚Äî The name of the database used by the application.
- `JWT_SECRET` ‚Äî A secure key used to sign JWT tokens. Ensure this is a strong and unique value.
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` ‚Äî Token for your Telegram bot (obtained from BotFather).
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME` ‚Äî Username of your Telegram bot.
- `STRIP_SECRET_KEY` ‚Äî Your Stripe API secret key for payment processing.

**Additional Notes**:
- The variable `POSTGRES_LOCAL_PORT` specifies the port used locally to connect to the database, while `POSTGRES_DOCKER_PORT` specifies the port inside the Docker container.
- `SPRING_LOCAL_PORT`, `SPRING_DOCKER_PORT`, and `DEBUG_PORT` define the ports for the application and debugging.
- Make sure to save the `.env` file and avoid committing it to version control to keep sensitive information secure.

### Step 3: Start the Application
Once the `.env` file is configured, navigate to the project's root directory using the terminal.

Use the following command to start the application and all required services via Docker Compose:

```bash
  docker compose up --build
```

What this does:
- This command builds the Docker images for the application and required services.
- It starts the application, database, and any other dependencies inside containers.
- Wait for the services to start. You should see logs indicating that the application and database are running.

### Step 4: Access the Application
After running the application, you can access it via the following endpoints:

#### üîß Local Environment (host machine)
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8088/api`
- Swagger UI: [http://localhost:8088/api/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8088/api/swagger-ui/index.html)

#### üê≥ Docker Container (inside container network)
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api`
